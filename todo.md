--  After declaring array, try to convert it to its equv
    pointer then store that in the variable.
    For the subscript op, rely on the types assigned to it by the semantic analyzer.
- arrays
    -mulitple dimensions array. 
- string
- fn pointer variable.
    - should be able to pass as function argument.
-struct
    -initializer list.
